Bitcloud Queue position

Tool ported from Dash's moocowmoo's gists:  https://gist.github.com/moocowmoo/5338fb594c88f57d374eb8b9603260ae

This will show you your Masternodes queue position and chance of receiving a payment for that round.
Because each block time is 5 minutes, this data changes often.

Make sure python v2 is installed and drop the files where your bitcloud-cli lives.

run like so:  ./get_queue_position.sh 45ba53cd4366700ae435345235cfcc4305034060030200abcdef345345352345-1
